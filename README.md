Hi, this is Isaias Ponce

I've worked in this project in my local computer, so i decided to upload it as a public github repository

Game of live, is basically the way how live happens, some cells die, and some new cells appear
This program was written in C language

## How to run the program locally.

```bash
make clean
make
./bin/vida -f 30 -c 30 -g 4 -s 2 -i 300 -n 5 -m

```
f: filas (N rows)
c: columnas (N columns)
g: Generaciones (N Generations)
s: time (N Microseconds)
i: Initial cells
n: N threads
m: mostrar (show)
